# Face_sketch_constructor_and_identity_attestation
In this modern epoch, crimes are rising at an alarming rate, which stands up as a significant challenge for governments to cope with. Speeding up the process of identifying and putting the criminal behind the bars is something that will accelerate the trust of the common layman in justice. To aid the law enforcement department to speed up the process of foremost step of identification of the culprit, this project can be proven as a boon for the same. Face sketches have played an important role, as the person who witnessed the whole accident has seen the criminals, which can help the police to tell the facial traits of the offender. Bygone are the days, in which waiting for the artist's arrival and the time it takes to draw adds more to the waiting time.

Face sketch constructor and identity attestation,is a web application that would help in the sketch construction and recognition.The project is built using efficient deep learning algorithms(CNN) and cloud services of AWS(Amazon Rekognition module). This application will offer the pick and drop services for facial elements from the side panel which would contain almost all kinds of features, and within a few minutes, we can get our sketch ready.Our application would not only be used in making the facial sketches but also would provide assistance in retrieving the actual photo and corresponding details of the questioned from the database which would be maintained.
